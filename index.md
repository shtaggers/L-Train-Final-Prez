- The closure of the L train should not have any major effects on the residents of Brownsville. For service to any area in Manhattan that the L train reaches, residents can take a short walk to the A, C, J, or 4 trains, which all travel to Manhattan. For service to any area in Brooklyn that the L train reaches, residents can take a short walk to the J train, which travels relatively parallel to the L train in Brooklyn. The only caveat is that residents would have to walk or transfer to a bus afterwards in order to reach where the L train route was. Although these routes are all relatively close and convenient for Brownsville residents, there may be concerns of overcrowding due to increased ridership.
