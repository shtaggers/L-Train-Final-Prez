- The closure of the L train should not have any major effects on the residents of Brownsville. For service to any area in Manhattan that the L train reaches, residents can take a short walk to the A, C, J, or 4 trains, which all travel to Manhattan. For service to any area in Brooklyn that the L train reaches, residents can take a short walk to the J train, which travels relatively parallel to the L train in Brooklyn. The only caveat is that residents would have to walk or transfer to a bus afterwards in order to reach where the L train route was. Although these routes are all relatively close and convenient for Brownsville residents, there may be concerns of overcrowding due to increased ridership. 

[Greenpoint](https://nahyongjun.github.io/Greenpoint/)

- The closure of the L train also does not have any major effects on the residents of Greenpoint. Residents can take buses and transfer to other buses or express buses. If residents live near the top of Greenpoint, they can take the bus to the 7 train and travel to Manhattan from there. If not, they can take the ferry that goes across the East River. Biking to Manhattan could be somewhat of a trek, but you would have to bike all the way down to Williamsburg bridge and take it from there. There are services available to mitigate the effects of the L train closure, but they are not the most time efficient or favorable. Residentâ€™s commute time will increase immensely.
